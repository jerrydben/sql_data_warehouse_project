**🚀 Welcome to the Sales Data Warehouse Project**

Welcome! I am Jeremiah Ogochukwu Ngiri, a Lead Business Intelligence Analyst. This repository showcases a complete Data Engineering workflow—transforming raw, disparate data into a structured environment for strategic intelligence.


This project demonstrates my expertise in SQL Server, Star Schema modeling, and ETL automation. Whether you are a recruiter looking at my technical stack or a fellow analyst, I hope this project provides clear insight into how I bridge the gap between complex data engineering and actionable business reporting


**📌 Project Objective**
The goal of this project was to engineer a modern, centralized Data Warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from two primary source systems: ERP and CRM. This unified environment enables advanced analytical reporting and informed decision-making by providing a single source of truth.


**🛠️ Technical Specifications**
Data Sources: Integrated high-volume datasets provided as CSV files from ERP and CRM systems.
Technology Stack: * Database Engine: SQL Server.
Data Engineering: Advanced SQL (Window Functions, CTEs).
ETL Process: Power Query for data cleansing and validation.
Modeling: Star Schema architecture.


**🏗️ Data Engineering Workflow**
1. Data Quality & Cleansing
Prior to integration, I performed extensive data cleansing to ensure high-accuracy data integrity. This included:
Resolving data quality issues across the ERP and CRM sources.
Standardizing datasets to ensure seamless joining during the integration phase.
Validating financial records and sales transactions for accuracy.
2. Integration & Modeling
I combined the sources into a user-friendly, high-performance data model designed for analytical queries:
Architecture: Developed a Star Schema to optimize relationships between sales transactions (Fact Table) and customer demographics (Dimension Table).
Analytical Queries: Leveraged SQL Window Functions to calculate complex sales growth metrics and performance trends.
Scope: Focused on the latest dataset to provide immediate, actionable strategic intelligence.


**📂 Documentation & Deliverables**
Data Model: Clear documentation of the schema to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
SQL Scripts: Optimized code for performance tuning and data transformation.
Validation Report: Summary of steps taken to resolve data quality issues.


**📊 Business Impact:**
Consolidated Reporting: Eliminated data silos between sales (CRM) and operational (ERP) departments.
Performance Tracking: Enabled executive leadership to drill down into departmental performance and revenue drivers.
Automation: Developed automated pipelines to reduce manual data preparation time.
